\section{Introduction.}
\par{Before we go nose to grindstone and deal
carefully with the details of Lie groups and Lie
algebras, it merits sketching the goal of this
paper both to motivate the preliminary results
and to allow readers to try to anticipate
significant connections as they go. We therefore
begin with the most important definition: a
\textbf{Lie group} is a group with smooth
composition and inversion maps that is also a
smooth manifold. All of this structure makes Lie
groups very nice to work with. We construct a
tangent space at the identity of the group, endow
it with a multiplication, and call it the
\textbf{Lie algebra}. We can then define a map
thats recovers much of the group structure from
the algebra. This means we can do much of our work
on the algebra (which, conveniently, is linear)
instead of on the group, partially reducing group
operation to a much simpler linear algebra
problem.} 

\section{Smooth manifolds.}

\par{Perhaps surprisingly, much Lie theory can be
covered without explicitly using manifolds. This
is done through matrix Lie groups. Since there is
is more than enough matrix Lie theory to fill two
lectures, and I believe it is the quickest and
most intuitive way to cover ground, matrices are
the idiom of most of this paper. However, it would
be wrong to leave manifolds completely out of the
picture. We will therefore begin with smooth
manifolds and prove a connection to matrix Lie
groups before leaving them in the background for
the rest of the paper. A significant result toward
the end establishes the limit of this approach.}

\subsection{Topological definitions.}

\par{We collect several preliminary definitions
pertinent to smooth manifolds (ยง5.1
in~\cite{Tu}).}

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item {A set $X$ equipped with a function
$\mathcal{N}(x)$ that assigns to each $x \in X$ a
nonempty collection of subsets $\{N\}$ (called
\textbf{neighborhoods} of $x$) is a
\textbf{topological space} if it satisfies the
following four axioms.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item {Each point $x \in X$  belongs to each
of its neighborhoods.}
\item {Each superset of a neighborhood of $x$
is also a neighborhood of $x$.}
\item {The intersection of any two
neighborhoods of $x$ is a neighborhood of
$x$.}
\item {Any neighborhood $N$ contains a
subneighborhood $M$ such that $N$ is a
    neighborhood of each point in $M$.}
\end{enumerate}}
\item {A set is \textbf{open} if it contains a
neighborhood of each point.} 
\item {The \textbf{basis} of a topological space
$M$ is some family $\mathcal{B}$ of open subsets
such that every open set in $M$ can be generated
by taking the union of some some sub-family of
$\mathcal{B}$.}
\item {A topological space is \textbf{second countable}
if it has a countable basis.}
\item {A \textbf{Hausdorff space} is a topological
space $M$ where $\forall x, y \in M$, $\exists
U_x, U_y$, neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, such that
$U_x \cap U_y = \emptyset$.}
\item {A \textbf{homemorphism} is a continuous
bijection between topological spaces with a
continuous inverse.}
\item {A \textbf{open cover} of $M$ is a
collection of open sets in ${U_a}$ whose union
$\cup U_a = M$.}
\item {A space is \textbf{locally Euclidean of
dimension $n$} if every point has a neighborhood
homeomorphic to an open subset of $\R^n$.}
\item {A \textbf{chart} is a neighborhood $U$ of a
point $p$ together with a homeomorphism $\phi: U
\to V$ for an open subset $V$ of $\R^n$. The chart
is written as the pair $(U, \phi)$}.
\item {A function is \textbf{smooth} if it is $C^\infty$.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Topological manifolds.}
\par{ยง5.1 in~\cite{Tu}.}
\begin{defn}
    We simply concatenate several definitions to
    define a \textbf{topological manifold of
    dimension \textit{n}}: a Hausdorff, second
    countable, locally Euclidean space of
    dimension $n$. Intuitively, this means that if
    you are standing on a topological manifold
    with terrible eyesight, as far as you can
    tell, you are standing in $\R^n$. We also
    require a few topological properties that make
    the manifold nicer to deal with.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
    Note that we require each neighborhood on a
    manifold to be homeomorphic to an open subset
    of $\R^n$. An object with some neighborhoods
    homeomorphic to open subsets of $\mathbb{H}^n$
    but not $\R^n$ is called a \textbf{manifold
    with boundary}, which we will not consider a
    manifold.
\end{rmk}

    
\begin{ex}
    Two nonintersecting open line segments $M =
    \{(x,0): x \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)\}$ form a
    $1$-manifold in $\R^2$. Note that no part of
    the definition requires the manifold to be
    connected. Here, we have two components, each
    locally homeomorphic to an open neighborhood
    of $\R^1$.
\end{ex}

\par{We will prove an non-example of a manifold, but first, we need a lemma.}

\begin{lem} Homeomorphisms preserve connected
components.\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    \par{Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological manifolds
    and $X = \cup X_i$ and $Y = \cup Y_j$ be their
    decompositions into their connected
    components. Let $f: X \to Y$ be a
    homeomorphism. Because $f$ is a homeomorphism,
    $f$ is continuous, so $f(X_i)$ is connected.
    Therefore, $f(X_i) \subseteq Y_j$ for some
    $Y_j$. Now because $f$ is a homeomorphism,
    $f^{-1}$ is continuous, so $f^{-1}(Y_j)$ is
    connected. Also, as long as $X_i$ is nonempty,
    $f^{-1}(Y_j) \cap X_i \neq \emptyset$.
    Therefore, $f^{-1}(Y_j) \subseteq X_i$}, since
    $X_i$ is connected. Applying $f$ to both sides
    yields $Y_j \subseteq f(X_i)$, completing the
    proof that $f(X_i) = Y_j$.
\end{proof}

\begin{nex} The unit cross in $\R^2$,
    $M = \{(x,y): x \in (-1,1) \; \&  \; y = 0 \:
    \cup \: y \in (-1,1) \; \& \; x = 0\}$, is not a
    topological manifold.
\end{nex}

\begin{proof}Assume toward contradiction that
    there exists a local homeomorphism $f: M \to
    \R^n$ such that $\forall x \in M$, $\exists$ a
    neighborhood $U \ni x$ such that $f(U)$ is
    open in $\R^n$ and $f\big|_U$ is a
    homeomorphism. Let $x = 0$. Then $\exists V$ a
    neighborhood containing $x$ such that
    $f\big|_V$ is a homeomorphism. Put $f(V) = Y$.
    Define $f^\prime$ as the restriction of $f$ to
    $V \setminus \{0\}$. This is a homeomorphism
    $V \setminus \{0\} \to Y \setminus \{f(0)\}$
    because restrictions of homeomorphisms are
    still homeomorphisms. However, $V \setminus
    \{0\}$ has $4$ connected components, while $Y
    \setminus \{f(0)\}$ has $2$ components for $n
    = 1$ and $1$ component for $f > 1$. Therefore,
    there exists no homeomorphism $f: M \to \R^n$,
    so $M$ is not a topological manifold.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Smooth manifolds.}
\par{ยง5.2 and ยง5.3 in~\cite{Tu}.}
\begin{defn}
    Two charts $(U, \phi)$ and $(U, \psi)$ are
    \textbf{compatible} if $\phi \circ \psi^{-1}$ and
    $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}$ are both $C^\infty$.
\end{defn}

\par{In other words, we can start in Euclidean
space, go up to the manifold via the inverse of
one map, and come back down via the other map,
all without trouble.}

\begin{rmk}
Obvserve that if $U \cap V =
\emptyset$, then the functions $\phi \circ
\psi^{-1}$ and $\psi \circ \phi^{-1}$ are
trivially $C^\infty$, so this definition is only
restrictive for charts on nondisjoint
neighborhoods.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}
An \textbf{atlas} on a topological manifold $M$ is a
collection $\mathcal{U} = \{(U_a, \phi_a)\}$ of
pairwise compatible charts such that $\cup
\{U_a\}$ forms an open cover of $M$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
An atlas $(U_a, \phi_a)$ is \textbf{maximal} if it
is not the proper subset of any atlas on $M$.
(There is a fair amount of discussion about the
philosophical status of this definition, but I
will spare you the details and remark that I have
never seen it play a crucial part in any
interesting result. Any atlas admits extension to
a unique maximal atlas, so we need not worry about
which maximal atlas to proceed with, allowing this
requirement to disappear into the background).
\end{defn}

\par{Finally, our main definition:}
\begin{defn} A \textbf{smooth
manifold} is a topological manifold $M$ together
with a maximal atlas.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
    \par{Any open subset of the Euclidean space $S
    \subseteq \R^n$ is a topological manifold with
    chart $(S, id)$.}
\end{ex}

\begin{ex}
The graph of $y = |x|$ in $\R^2$ is also a
smooth manifold of dimension $1$ with the
coordinate map $(x, |x|) \mapsto x$. The cusp at
$x = 0$ does not prevent the graph from being a
smooth $1$-manifold: the projection down to the
$x$-axis remains smooth.
\end{ex}

\begin{ex} The sphere $S^1$ is a $1$-manifold in $\R^2$.
Define four open neighborhoods $U_+ = \{(x,y) \in
S^1 : x > 0\}$, $U_{-} = \{(x,y) \in S^1 : x <
0\}$, $V_+ = \{(x,y) \in S^1 : y > 0\}$, and
$V_{-} = \{(x,y) \in S^1 : y < 0\}$, with maps
projecting onto the axis of the variable not
restricted. Clearly, these neighborhoods cover
$S^1$, and each is homeomorphic to an open subset
of $\R^1$.
\end{ex}   

\par{We define here two basic sets of matrices.}

\begin{defn}
    $M(n,\K)$ is the set of all $n \times
    n$ matrices with entries in $\K$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
    From now on, we let $\K = \C$ and elide the
    field in our definition of matrix groups: we
    write $M(n)$ instead of $M(n, \C)$, $GL(n)$
    instead of $GL(n, \C)$, and so on, flagging
    each case when the field is not $\C$. Most
    but not all of the results below hold also
    for real matrices.
\end{rmk}

\begin{defn}
    \textbf{$GL(n)$} is the set of all
    $n \times n$ matrices with nonzero determinant. 
\end{defn}

\par{To prove the next theorem, we need a lemma:}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:smooth} Any open subset of a smooth manifold
is a smooth manifold.\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $M^\prime$ be an open subset of $M$ and
$M$ a smooth manifold with atlas $\{(U_a,
\phi_a)\}$. Then $\{(U_a \cap M^\prime, \phi_a)\}$ is
an atlas of $M^\prime$, so $M^\prime$ is
itself a smooth manifold.
\end{proof}

\begin{them}$GL(n)$ is a smooth $2n^2$
manifold.\end{them} 
\begin{proof}
To begin, we identify $M(n)$ with $\R^{2n^2}$.
$\R^{2n^2}$ is trivially a smooth manifold: take
atlas $\{(\R^{2n^2}, id)\}$. Thus, $M(n)$ is a
smooth manifold. The determinant $\det: GL(n) \to
\R^2 \setminus \{0\}$ is polynomial in the entries
of the matrix of which it is taken, so it is
continuous. Its image is an open subset of $\R^2$.
The preimage of any continuous map to an open set
is open, so the preimage of $\det$,
$GL(n)$, is an open subset of $M(n)$. Therefore,
by~\ref{lem:smooth}, $GL(n)$ is a smooth manifold of
dimension $2n^2$.
\end{proof}

\section{Matrix groups.}

\par{Before proceding to matrix Lie group theory, we prove some crucial results of a few classical matrix groups.}

\subsection{Maximality of the general linear group.}

\par{We first prove that $GL(n)$ is the maximal matrix group, then go on to prove that several other classical matrix groups are subgroups.}
\begin{them}
    $GL(n)$ is the maximal matrix group.
\end{them}

\begin{proof}
\par{$GL(n)$ inherits associativity from the
definition of matrix multiplication.} 
\par{Recall from linear algebra that $\det(MN) =
\det(M)\det(N)$. Let $M, N \in GL(n)$. By the
definition of $GL(n)$, $\det(M) \neq 0$ and
$\det(N) \neq 0$. Then $\det(MN) = \det(M)\det(N)
\neq 0$, so $MN \in GL(n)$.} \par{Also, $\det(I)
\neq 0$ and $MI = IM = M$, $\forall AM\in GL(n)$,
so $GL(n) \ni I$.} 
\par{Finally, recall from linear algebra that a
square matrix with nonzero determinant possesses
an inverse. Then $\forall M \in GL(n)$, $\exists
M^{-1}: MM^{-1} = M^{-1}M = I$. This implies
$\det(M^{-1}) = 1/ \det(M)$, so $\det(M^{-1}) \neq
0$, so $M^{-1} \in GL(n)$. Therefore, $GL(n)$ is a
matrix group.}

\par{Recall from linear algebra that nonsquare
matrices and matrices with determinants of $0$
lack inverses. Then any set with such a matrix
fails to provide an inverse for each of its
elements, so it is not a group.}

\par{$\therefore GL(n)$ is a matrix group and any set
of matrices with an element not in $GL(n)$ is not
a matrix group, so $GL(n)$ is the maximal matrix
group.}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Classical matrix group definitions.}
\par{First, we define these classical matrix groups.}

\begin{defn}
$SL(n) = \{M \in GL(n): \det(M) = 1\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
$\son = \{M \in
GL(n, \R): M^T M = M M^T = I$ and $\det(M) = 1\}$. This is a very
important matrix group, so we define it and
prove that it is a subgroup of $GL(n, \R)$, even
though the rest of the paper deals with
complex matrices.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
$\sun = \{M \in GL(n) : MM^*
= M^*M = I$ and $\det(M) = 1$ and $M_{ij} \in
\C\}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
There are several ways of defining $SP(2n)$, but
we will take as definitional $SP(2n) = \{M \in
GL(2n): M^T\Omega M = \Omega\}$, with \[\Omega =
\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -I_n \\
I_n & 0 \end{bmatrix}.\] Note the $2n$: this
definition breaks if we tried $SP(3)$, for example.
\end{defn}

\subsection{Classical matrix groups are matrix groups.}

\begin{prop}$SL(n)$ is a matrix group.\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\par{$SL(n)$ inherits associativity from the definition of matrix multiplication.}
\par{For $M, N \in SL(n)$, $\det(MN) = \det(M) \det(N) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$, so $MN \in SL(n)$, so $SL(n)$ is closed under composition.}
\par{For $M \in SL(n)$, $\det(M^{-1}) = 1 /
\det(M) = 1 / 1 = 1$, so $M^{-1} \in SL(n)$.}
\par{$\det(I) = 1$, so $SL(n) \ni I$.}
\par{$\therefore SL(n)$ is associative, closed under inversion and composition, and contains the identity, so $SL(n)$ is a matrix group.}
\end{proof}
    
\begin{prop}$\son$ is a matrix group.\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\par{$\son$ inherits associativity from the definition of matrix multiplication.}
\par{For $M \in \son$, $MM^T = I$ by definition,
so ${(MM^T)}^{-1} = I^{-1} = I$. Also
\[\begin{aligned} {(MM^T)}^{-1} & =
{(M^T)}^{-1}M^{-1} \\ & = {(M^{-1})}^T M^{-1} \\ &
= M^{-1}{(M^{-1})}^T.\end{aligned}\] Each equality
is given by a straightforward property of matrices
from linear algebra. This implies that
$M^{-1}{(M^{-1})}^T = I$. $\det(M^{-1}) = 1$ is
provided by $\son \subseteq SL(n)$. The $M_{ij}
\in \R$ condition is provided by the closure of
$\R$ under negation and division, which are the
operations on the entries that produce inversion.
$M^{-1} \in \son$. Therefore, $\son$ is closed
under inversion.}
\par{For $M, N \in \son$:
\[\begin{aligned}(MN){(MN)}^{T} & = MN(N^{T}M^{T})
\\ & = M(NN^T)M^T \\ & = MIM^T \\ & = MM^T \\ & =
I.\end{aligned}\] Again each equality is provided
by a straightforward property of matrices from
linear algebra. $\det(MN) = 1$ is provided by
$\son \subseteq SL(n)$. The $M_{ij} \in \R$
condition is provided by the closure of $\R$ under
addition and multiplication, the operations on the
entries that produce composition.}
\par{$II^T = II = I$, so $\son \ni I$.}
\par{$\therefore \son$ is associative, closed under inversion and composition, and contains the identity, so $\son$ is a matrix group.}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}$\sun$ is a matrix group.\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
This proof is identical to the preceding one, \textit{mutatis
mutandis}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}$SP(2n)$ is a matrix group.\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\par{$SP(2n)$ inherits associativity from the definition of matrix multiplication.}
\par{Let $M \in SP(2n)$, so $M^T \Om M = \Om$.
Observe that $\Om^{-1} = -\Om$. Then \[\begin{aligned}{(M^T \Om
M)}^{-1} & = \Om^{-1} \\ & = -\Om,\end{aligned}\] so $-{(M^T \Om
M)}^{-1} = \Om$, which allows finally
\[\begin{aligned}
    -{(M^T \Om M)}^{-1} & = -M^{-1} \Om^{-1}
    {(M^T)}^{-1} \\ & = M^{-1} \Om {(M^T)}^{-1} \\
    & = \Om.
\end{aligned}\] Multiplying the penultimate and ultimate terms by $M$ on the left and by $M^T$ on the right gives
\[
    \Om = M \Om M^T,
\] showing that $M^T \in SP(2n)$. Then we may replace $M$ with $M^T$ in any of the above equations without jeopardizing the equality. Take $\Om = M^{-1}\Om{(M^T)}^{-1}$ and replace $M$ with $M^T$:
\[\begin{aligned}
{(M^T)}^{-1} \Om {({(M^T)}^T)}^{-1} & =
{(M^T)}^{-1} \Om M^{-1} \\
& = {(M^{-1})}^T \Om M^{-1} \\ & = \Om,
\end{aligned}\] showing that $M^{-1} \in
SP(2n)$, which is (finally) the desired
result. Therefore, $SP(2n)$ is closed under
inversion.}
\par{For $M, N \in SP(2n)$,
\[\begin{aligned}
{(MN)}^T \Om (MN) & = N^T M^T \Om M N \\ & =
N^T \Om N \\ & = \Om,
\end{aligned}\] so $MN \in SP(2n)$, so $SP(2n)$ is closed under composition.
}
\par{Trivially, $I^T\Om I = I \Om I =  \Om$, so $SP(2n) \ni I$.}
\par{$\therefore SP(2n)$ is associative, closed under inversion and composition, and contains the identity, so $SP(2n)$ is a matrix group.}
\end{proof}

\par{Before moving on to matrix Lie groups, we
emphasize that this section has established that
$SL(n)$, $\son$, $\sun$, and $SP(n)$ are
subgroups of $GL(n)$ (stipulating that $n$ is even
in the case of $SP(n)$, respecting our previous
notation). With Cartanโs Theorem, to be
established later, this gets us further than
we might expect.}

\section{Matrix Lie groups.}

\subsection{Definitions and discussion.}

\par{There are at least three definitions of
โmatrix Lie groupโ that could come into effect
here.}

\begin{defn}\label{def1} A matrix Lie group is a
matrix group that is also a Lie group.\end{defn}
\par{In particular, this means that the group is
realized as a set of matrices satisfying the group
axioms, that the group has smooth inversion and
composition maps, and also that the group has
smooth manifold structure. This is the most honest
and least insightful definition. To use this with
no other machinery, for example, we might need to
build a new atlas for each matrix Lie group by
hand.}

\begin{defn}\label{def2} A matrix Lie
group is a subgroup of a matrix group and a
submanifold of a manifold.
\end{defn} 
\par{This definition is slightly smarter. It does
not require us to establish all the structure for
our matrix Lie group \textit{de novo}. Instead,
all it asks is that we show that the set in
question can inherit all the relevant properties
from superset. Allowing a matrix group to be a
subgroup of itself and a manifold to be a
submanifold of itself, this definition is also
perfectly broad.}

\begin{defn}\label{def3} A matrix Lie
group is a subgroup of $GL(n)$ closed under
nonsingular limits.
\end{defn}
\par{We have already established
that $GL(n)$ is the maximal matrix group and that
$GL(n)$ is a smooth manifold, so this definition should
not come completely out of the blue. However, it
should still be surprising. For any subgroup $G$ of
$GL(n)$, as long as any convergent sequence of
matrices $M_n \in G$ converges to a matrix in $G$
or leaves $GL(n)$ altogether, $G$ is a matrix Lie
group. No direct proof of its manifold structure
is necessary. This is the route that allows one to
study Lie theory in a surprising amount of depth
without ever touching manifolds.}

\subsection{Direct proof: the general linear group is a Lie group.}
\par{It would be cheating to go through this whole
paper without a single complete and direct proof
that some object is a Lie group. It has already
been shown that $GL(n)$ is a matrix group and a
smooth manifold, so all that remains is to show
that the inversion and composition maps are
smooth.}

\begin{them}$GL(n)$ is a Lie group.\end{them}
\begin{proof}
\par{Let $\mu : GL(n) \times GL(n) \to GL(n)$ be
the matrix multiplication ($\sim$ group composition) map.
Then $\mu(A, B) = AB$, with entries calculated 
\[
    {(AB)}_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}b_{kj}.
\] 
This is a polynomial in the entries of $A$ and
$B$, so it is $C^\infty$.}

\par{Let $\upiota: GL(n) \to GL(n)$ be the matrix
inversion ($\sim$ group inversion) map. Recall
from linear algebra that the $(i,j)$-minor,
denoted $M_{i,j}$, of a matrix is the determinant
of the submatrix formed by deleting row $i$ and
column $j$ of the matrix. The formula for entries
of the inverse of a matrix $A$ is 
\[\begin{aligned} {(\upiota(A))}_{ij} & =
{(A^{-1})}_{ij} \\ & =
\frac{1}{\det(A)}{(-1)}^{i+j}M_{j,i}
\end{aligned}\] by Cramerโs rule. $M_{j,i}$ is a
polynomial in the entries of $A$, so it is
$C^\infty$, and $1/ \det(A)$ is also $C^\infty$ as
long as $\det(A) \neq 0$, which is assured by the
fact that $A \in GL(n)$. Therefore this formula is
$C^\infty$ in the entries of $A$, so the version
map is $C^\infty$.
}
\par{This completes the proof that $GL(n)$ is a Lie group.}
\end{proof}

\section{Matrix exponential and logarithm functions.}
\par{We now pivot to build the machinery that will be
used to connect Lie groups to Lie algebras. (From
chapter 2 in~\cite{Hall}.)}

\subsection{Matrix exponential function.}
\par{
Recall the power series of $e^x$ for $x \in \C$:
\[
    e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^n}{n!}.
\] This is a theorem due to Euler in the scalar case, but we will take it as a definition in the matrix case.}
\begin{defn}
\[\begin{aligned} e^X = \exp(X) & =
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{X^n}{n!} \\ & = I +
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{X^n}{n!}.
\end{aligned}\] Some texts use $e^X$ rather
than $\exp(X)$. The latter is preferred here
because it can be confusing to conflate the
scalar- and matrix-valued functions.
\end{defn}
\par{It is not yet clear that this is a sensible
notion, for we do not know whether the power
series converges.}
\begin{defn}
To help prove the convergence of this power series, we
define the \textbf{Hilbert-Schmidt norm} of a
matrix:
\[
    \V X \V = {\Big[\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}{(x_{ij})}^2 \Big]}^{1/2}.
\]
\end{defn} 
\par{The following two inequalities follow quickly
from properties of the metric on the field over
which $M(n, \K)$ is defined, and are not proven here:
\[\begin{aligned}
    \V X + Y \V & \leq \V X \V + \V Y \V \\
    \V XY \V & \leq \V X \V \V Y \V.
\end{aligned}
\] By induction on the second inequality, setting $X =
Y$, we also
have $\V X^n \V \leq \V X \V^n$.}
\begin{them} $\exp(X)$ converges absolutely and is
continuous
$\forall X \in M(n)$.
\end{them}
\begin{proof}
\par{
    We say that a sequence of matrices $\{X_m\}$
    converges to $X$ if ${(X_m)}_{ij} \to (X)_{ij}$
    as $m \to \infty$. It follows
    straightforwardly that $X_m$ converges to $X$
    if and only if $\V X_m - X \V \to 0$ as $m \to
    \infty$. Then 
\[
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\V X^n\V}{n!} \leq \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\V X \V^n}{n!}.
\] The right-hand side is the power series for $e^{\V X \V}$ with $\V X \V \in \R$, which converges absolutely. Therefore, $\exp(X)$ converges absolutely.
}
\par{
Note also that each entry in $X^n$ is a product of
the entries of $X$, so $X^n$ is a continuous
function of $X$, $\forall n \in \N$, so the
partial sums are continuous. By the Weierstrass
$M$-test, $\exp(X)$ converges uniformly for
matrices with norms in $(0, \V X \V)$. For any
matrix $M \in M(n)$, we can choose $M +
\varepsilon$ so that $\exp$ converges uniformly on
an open set containing $M$. Therefore by the
uniform convergence theorem, $\exp(X)$ is
continuous on all of $M(n)$.
}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:expprop} We now prove several important properties of the
matrix exponential function.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\exp(0)= I$.
    \item If $XY = YX$, $\exp(X + Y) = \exp(X)\exp(Y) = \exp(Y)\exp(X)$.
    \item ${\exp(X)}^{-1} = {\exp(-X)}$.
    \item $\exp((\alpha +\beta)X) = \exp(\alpha X)
    \cdot \exp(\beta X)$ for $\alpha, \beta \in
    \C$. 
    \item $\forall C \in GL(n)$, $\exp(CXC^{-1}) = C\exp(X)C^{-1}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\par{(1) follows straightforwardly from the definition
of the power series beginning at $n=1$.} \par{To
see (2), consider $\exp(X)\exp(Y)$, multiplying
term-by-term in
such a way that we collect all terms where powers
add to $m$. Multiplying term-by-term is permitted
because both series converge absolutely. This means:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\exp(X) \exp(Y) & = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\sum_{n=0}^{m}\frac{X^n}{n!} \frac{Y^{m-n}}{(m-n)!}  \\
& = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{m!}\sum_{n=0}^{m}\frac{m!}{n!(m-n)!}X^{n}Y^{m-n},
\end{aligned}
\] after multiplying by $m!/m!$ and rearranging. Now, note that exponentiation of matrices does not behave exactly like exponentiation of reals. For example 
\[{(X+Y)}^2 = X^2 + XY + YX + Y^2,\] which does
not equal the familiar form
\[\sum_{n=0}^2 \binom{m}{n}X^n Y^{m-n}\] if $X$
and $Y$ fail to commute. In this case, however,
since $X$ and $Y$ commute,
\[
    {(X+Y)}^m = \sum_{n=0}^{m} \frac{m!}{n!(m-n)!}X^{n} Y^{m-n}.
\] Plugging in to the previous equation
\[\begin{aligned}
    \exp(X)\exp(Y) & = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty}\frac{{(X+Y)}^{m}}{m!} \\ & = \exp(X+Y).
\end{aligned}\]
}
\par{To prove (3), let $Y = -X$. We know that
$-XX = X(-X)$, so $-X$ and $X$ commute, so (2)
applies. Then 
\[\begin{aligned}\exp(-X + X) & = \exp(-X) \exp(X)
\\ & = \exp(0) \\ & = I,\end{aligned}\] 
so $\exp(-X) = {\exp(X)}^{-1}$. This implies that
$\exp(X) \in GL(n)$, $\forall X \in M(n)$.}
\par{(4) is also a special case of (2), since
$\alpha X$ is equivalent to $(\alpha I)X$, and
$\alpha I$ commutes with $\forall X \in M(n)$.}
\par{To prove (5), note that ${(CXC^{-1})}^n =
CX^n C^{-1}$ is a basic result in linear algebra.
This implies that the power series of
$\exp(CXC^{-1})$ and $C\exp(X)C^{-1}$ are
term-by-term equivalent.}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} Let $X \in M(n)$. Then for $t \in \R$,
$\exp(tX)$ is a smooth curve in
$M(n)$, and 
\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{dt} \exp(tX) & = X\exp(tX) \\ & = \exp(tX)X.
\end{aligned}\] This implies
\[
    \frac{d}{dt} \exp(tX) \Big|_{t=0} = X,
\] since $\exp(0) = I$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} This follows simply from
differentiating the power series term by term.
This is permitted because each entry
${(\exp(tX))}_{jk}$ of $\exp(tX)$ is given by a
convergent power series in $t$, and one can
differentiate a power series term by term within
its radius of convergence. This holds for all
entries of the matrix, so it holds for the matrix
as a whole.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}\label{prop:weirdexp}
    For all $X, Y \in M(n)$, we have
\[
    \exp(X+Y) = \lim_{m\to\infty} {(\exp(X/m)\exp(Y/m))}^m.
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is long and not very interesting
    and, moreover, requires a fairly substantial
    lemma that is also not very interesting,
    so it is omitted with a reference to
    (\cite{Hall}, 39--40).
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} For $\forall X \in M(n)$, we have 
\[
    \det(\exp(X)) = e^{tr(X)}.
\]
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
\par{Suppose $X$ is diagonalizable with
eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \hdots, \lambda_n$. Then
$X = CDC^{-1}$ for $D$ diagonal, so $\exp(X) =
\exp(CDC^{-1}) = C\exp(D)C^{-1}$ by proprty (5). Clearly
$\exp(D)$ is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues
$e^{\lambda_1}, \hdots, e^{\lambda_n}$. Then
$\det(X) = \det(D) = e^{\lambda_1}\cdot \hdots
\cdot e^{\lambda_n}$. On the other hand, $tr(X) =
tr(D) = \lambda_1 + \hdots + \lambda_n$. Therefore
$e^{tr(X)} = e^{tr(D)} = e^{\lambda_1 + \hdots +
\lambda_n} = e^{\lambda_1} \cdot \hdots \cdot
e^{\lambda_n}$.}


\par{If $X \in M(n, \C)$ is not diagonalizable,
then there is a sequence $\{D_n\}$ with
$\lim_{n\to\infty}D_n = D$ such that $X =
CDC^{-1}$ for some invertible matrix $C$.
Then also $tr(X) = tr(D)$ and $\det(X) = \det(D)$,
so the proof goes through identically. (This theorem does not hold for $X \in M(n, \R)$
because an arbitrary real matrix cannot be
approximated by a diagonal matrix.)}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Matrix logarithm function.}
\par{It is also necessary to define the matrix logarithm function, which, as we will see, is the inverse of the matrix exponential in its radius of convergence.}
\par{For $z \in \C$, recall the power series
\[
    \log(z) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} {(-1)}^{n+1} \frac{{(z-1)}^n}{n},
\] which we state but do not prove is defined and holomorphic in a circle of radius $1$ about $z = 1$. (Proof in~\cite{Hall} 36--7.) This function has the following two crucial properties:
\[
    e^{\log(z)} = z,
\] for $z$ with $\vert z - 1 \vert < 1$, and
\[
    \log(e^u) = u
\] for $u$ with $\vert u \vert < \log2$. (This condition means $\vert e^u - 1\vert < 1$).
}
\begin{defn}
Analogously, we define for $A \in M(n)$
\[
    \log(X) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{(-1)}^{n+1}\frac{{(X-I)}^n}{n}
\] whenever the series converges. Since the series has 
radius of convergence $1$ for $z \in \C$ and $\V
{(X-I)}^n \V \leq \V X-I \V^n$ for $n \geq 1$, if
$\V X - I \V < 1$, the matrix-valued series
converges and is continuous. Note that even
outside that radius the series converges if $X-I$
is nilpotent, that is, if $\exists n : {(X-I)}^n = 0$.
(We call such an $X$
\textbf{unipotent}.)\end{defn}
\begin{prop} 
Within this radius of convergence,
\[
    \exp(\log(X)) = X,
\] and for all $X \in M(n)$ with $\V X \V < \log(2)$, $\V \exp(X) \V < 1$ and
\[
    \log(\exp(X)) = X.
\] We state but do not prove this theorem of which a proof exists in (\cite{Hall}, 38--9).
\end{prop}

\subsection{One-parameter subgroups.}
\par{With the matrix exponential and logarithm functions defined, we can now define one-parameter subgroups, which are used in generating the Lie algebra of a Lie group.}
\begin{defn}\label{def:gh}
A one-parameter subgroup of $GL(n)$ is a group homomorphism $A: \R^{+} \to
GL(n)$. This implies the following: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A$ is continuous.
    \item $A(t+s) = A(t)A(s)$.
    \item $A(0) = I$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}

\par{We state but do not prove the following lemma, of which a proof be found in (\cite{Hall}, 41--2).}
\begin{lem}\label{lem:sqrt} Fix some $\varepsilon$ with
$\varepsilon < \log 2$. Let $B_{\varepsilon / 2}$ be the
ball of radius $\varepsilon / 2$ around the $0$ in
$M(n)$, and let $U = \exp(B_{\varepsilon/2})$. Then
every $X \in U$ has a unique square root $Y$ in
$U$, given by $Y = \exp(\frac{1}{2}\log X)$.
\end{lem}

\par{Intuitively, this says that if we take some
sufficiently small ball around the origin as the preimage of $\exp$,
every matrix $X$ in the image has a unique square
root $Y$ also in the image, which is found
simply by $Y =
\exp(\frac{1}{2}\log X)$. It is easy to check that
$Y^2 = X$, so the only real work is to prove uniqueness.}

\par{With this, we can prove the crucial result relating one-parameter subgroups to the matrix exponential function.}
\begin{them} If $A$ is a one-parameter
subgroup of $GL(n)$, there exists a unique $n
\times n$ matrix such that $A(t) = \exp(tX)$.
\end{them}
\begin{proof} 
\par{Uniqueness is immediate: if
$\exists X: \exp(tX) = A(t)$, then $X =
\frac{d}{dt}A(t)\big|_{t=0}$. Now to prove
existence. Let $U = \exp(B_{\varepsilon / 2})$ as in
the lemma, so $U$ is an open set in $GL(n)$. By
the continuity of $A$, $\exists t_0 > 0$ such that
$A(t) \in U$ for all $t: |t| \leq t_0$. In other
words, $A$ is continuous, and its output is in $U$
at $t=0$, so if we keep $t$ within some $t_0$ of
$0$, the output will stay within $U$. Now define
\[
    X = \frac{1}{t_0}\log(A(t_0)),
\] which means that
\[
    t_0X = \log(A(t_0)).    
\] Because $\log(A(t_0)) \in B_{\varepsilon/2}$, we also have 
$t_0X \in B_{\varepsilon/2}$ and $\exp(t_0X) = \exp(\log(
A(t_0))) = A(t_0)$. Clearly, $A(t_0/2)$ is also in $U$, and
${A(t_0/2)}^2 = A(t_0)$ by a property of group
homomorphisms (\ref{def:gh}). By~\ref{lem:sqrt},
$A(t_0)$ has a unique square root in $U$, which is
$\exp(t_0X/2)$. This implies that $A(t_0/2) =
\exp(t_0X/2)$. By induction, $A(t_0/2^k) =
\exp(t_0X/2^k)$, $\forall k \in \N$. We have
\[\begin{aligned} A(mt_0/2k^2) & = {A(t_0/2^k)}^m \\ & =
{\exp(t_0X/2^k)}^m \\ & = \exp(mt_0X/2^k)
\end{aligned},\]
with the first equality by a property of group
homomorphisms (\ref{def:gh}), the second by
$A(t_0/2^k) = \exp(t_0X/2^k)$, and
the third the
property of the exponential function ${\exp(M)}^m = \exp(mM)$.}
\par{Therefore $A(t) = \exp(tX)$ for all $t =
mt_0/2^k$. 
There exist $m, t_0, k$ to recover any arbitrary
$t$ because the set of numbers of the form $t =
mt_0/2^k$ is dense in $\R$. Moreover,
$\exp(tX)$ and $A(t)$ are both continuous. Therefore,
$A(t) = \exp(tX)$ for $t \in \R$.}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} The exponential map $\exp(X)$ is smooth
(infinitely differentiable).\end{prop}
\begin{proof} We have already
proven that $\exp(tX)$ is smooth, but the present proposition
is different: we are proving that we can take the
derivative in the direction of an arbitrary
matrix, which is stronger than taking the
derivative with respect to the parameter $t$.
Nonetheless, this proof proceeds similarly. Note
that each entry ${(X^m)}_{jk}$ of $X^m$ is a homogeneous
polynomial of degree $m$ in the entries of $X$.
Thus, the series for the function ${(X^m)}_{jk}$ has
the form of a multivariable power series. Since
the series converges on all of $M(n)$, it is
permissible to differentiate the power series
term-wise as many times as desired, which means
that the function ${(X^m)}_{jk}$ is smooth. The
smoothness of the exponential map follows
immediately.
\end{proof}

\par{We state but do not prove the following
proposition, which is noteworthy but will not be
used anywhere in this paper. The proof is sketched
in (\cite{Hall}, 48)}
\begin{prop} For $X \in GL(n)$,
$\exists A \in GL(n): \exp(A) = X$.\end{prop}

\section{Lie algebras.}
\par{We now have the tools to make good use of the
notion of a \textbf{Lie algebra}, which we will
define then apply.}

\subsection{Definitions.}
\begin{defn}A Lie algebra $\g$ over $\K = \R$
or $\C$ is a $\K$-vector space with a bracket operation
$[\cdot,\cdot]$ that satisfies the following
properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item bilinearity: $[aX + bY, Z] = a[X, Z] +
    b[Y, Z]$ and $[Z, aX + bY] = a[Z, X] +
    b[Z, Y]$
    \item antisymmetry: $[X,Y] = -[Y,X]$
    \item Jacobi identity: $[X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z,
    X]] + [Z, [X, Y]] = 0$
\end{itemize}
for $X, Y, Z \in \g$ and $a \in \K$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}We use lowercase Gothic characters to
denote Lie algebras, with the Lie algebra of a Lie
group $G$ as $\g$.\end{rmk}

\begin{defn} The vector space of matrices in
$M(n)$ with the bracket defined by the commutator 
\[
    [X, Y] = XY - YX
\] is denoted $\gl(n)$, or $\gl$.
\end{defn}

\begin{them}$\gl(n)$ is a Lie algebra.\end{them}
\begin{proof}
\par{We check that the commutator satisfies
bilinearity, antisymmetry, and the Jacobi
identity.}
\par{$[aX + bY, Z] = (aX + bY)Z - Z(aX + bY)$ by
the definition of the commutator, which 
\[\begin{aligned}& = aXZ + bYZ - ZaX - ZbY \\
& = aXZ + bYZ - aZX - bZY \\
& = aXZ - aZX + bYZ - bZY \\
& = a(XZ - ZX) + b(YZ - ZY) \\
& = a[X, Z] + b[Y, Z].\end{aligned}\] The proof for linearity
in the second coordinate is identical,
\textit{mutatis mutandis}.}
\par{Straightforwardly from the definition of the
commutator, it follows that
\[\begin{aligned}
    [X, Y] & = XY - YX \\ & = -(YX - XY) \\ & = -[Y,X].
\end{aligned}\]}
\par{Expanding by the definition of the
commutator 
\[\begin{aligned} 
&\quad [X, [Y, Z]] + [Y, [Z,
X]] + [Z, [X, Y]] \\ 
& = [X, YZ - ZY] + [Y, ZX - XZ] +
[Z, XY - YX] \\
& = X(YZ - ZY) - (YZ-ZY)X + Y(ZX-XZ) - (ZX-XZ)Y +
Z(XY-YX) - (XY-YX)Z \\
& = XYZ - XZY - YZX + ZYX + YZX - YXZ - ZXY + XZY
+ ZXY - ZYX - XYZ + YXZ \\
& = 0,\end{aligned}\] cancelling like terms.}
\par{Therefore, the commutator is a valid bracket,
so $\gl(n)$ is a Lie algebra.}
\end{proof}

\par{The following theorem is significant but
surprisignly difficult to prove, so we merely
state it.}
\begin{them} (\textbf{Adoโs Theorem}.)
    Every finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\g$
    over a field $\K$ of characteristic zero is
    isomorphic to a Lie algebra of square matrices under
    the commutator bracket.
\end{them}
\par{This means that as long as we are working
over non-pathological fields, $\gl$ and its
subalgebras are the only ones we need. This
theorem is one reason that we can get further than
we might expect using matrix Lie groups.}

\begin{ex}
The most familiar example of a Lie algebra is
$\R^3$ equipped with the traditional
cross-product. To prove that the cross product is
a valid Lie bracket operation, it suffices to
demonstrate that it is antisymmetric and follows
the Jacobi identity on the basis vectors.
Antisymmetry is definitional:
\[\ihat \times \jhat = - \jhat \times \ihat,\]
\[\jhat \times \khat = - \khat \times \jhat,\]
\[\khat \times \ihat = - \ihat \times \khat.\] The
Jacobi identity follows from computation: 
\[\begin{aligned}
    \ihat \times (\jhat \times \khat) + \jhat
    \times (\khat \times \ihat) + \khat \times
    (\jhat \times \jhat)
    & = \ihat \times \ihat +
    \jhat \times \jhat + \khat \times \khat \\ & = 0.
\end{aligned}\]
\end{ex}
\begin{rmk}
Any commutative algebra is also trivially a Lie
algebra, where $[\cdot,\cdot] \equiv 0$ because
$XY = YX$.
\end{rmk}

\subsection{The Lie algebra of a matrix Lie group.}
\begin{defn} Let $G$ be a matrix Lie
group. The \textbf{โLie algebraโ} of $G$, denoted
$\g$, is the set of all matrices $X$
such that $\exp(tX) \in G$, $\forall t \in \R$.
\end{defn}

\par{This definition states that the โLie algebraโ
of a Lie group is the set of all matrices whose
corresponding one-parameter subgroup lies entirely
in $G$. We call it a โLie algebraโ for now because
we have not shown that it is a Lie algebra
according to the original definition.}
\par{Note that $\exp(X) \in G$ does not
necessarily imply $X \in \g$: our requirement is
stronger.}
\par{We now show that $\g$, our โLie algebra,โ is indeed a Lie algebra.}

\begin{them}
    Let $G$ be a matrix Lie group with Lie algebra
    $\g$. Then $\forall X, Y \in \g$, the
    following results hold.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\forall A \in G, AXA^{-1} \in \g$.
    \item $\forall s \in \R, sX \in \g$.
    \item $X + Y \in \g$.
    \item $XY - YX \in \g$.
\end{itemize}
It follows from (2) and (3) that $\g$ is a vector
space, and from (4) that $\g$ is closed under the
bracket $[X,Y] = XY - YX$, so it is a Lie algebra.
\end{them}

\begin{proof}
\par{For (1), recall that 
\[\exp(t(AXA^{-1})) = A \exp(tX) A^{-1}\]
by~\ref{prop:expprop}. This is in $G$ because all
three of its terms are in $G$.}

\par{For (2), note that $\exp(t(sX)) =
\exp((ts)X)$, which is in $G$ by the
definition of $\g$. This implies that $sX \in
\g$.}

\par{For (3), note that
\[\exp(t(X+Y)) = \lim_{t \to
\infty}{[\exp(tX/m)\exp(tY/m)]}^m\]
by~\ref{prop:weirdexp}. Then $(\exp(tX/m))$ and
$(\exp(tX/m))$ are in $G$. We know that $G$ is
closed under composition, so $\exp(tX/m)\exp(tY/m)
\in G$. Exponentiation is repeated composition
and, again, $G$ is closed under composition, so
${[\exp(tX/m)\exp(tY/m)]}^m \in G$.
By~\ref{prop:expprop} $\exp(t(X+Y))$ in $GL(n)$.
$G$ is defined as a matrix Lie group, so
by~\ref{def3} it is closed in $GL(n)$. Therefore
$\exp(t(X+Y)) \in G$. This finally shows that
$\exp(t(X+Y)) \in G$, so $X + Y \in \g$. }

\par{For (4), let $X, Y \in \g$ and consider
\[\begin{aligned}
    \frac{d}{dt}(\exp(tX)Y\exp(-tX))\Big|_{t=0} &
    = (XY)\exp(0) + (\exp(0)Y)(-X)\\ 
& = XY - YX.\end{aligned}\] Now by (1), $\exp(tX) Y \exp(-tX)
\in G, \forall t \in \R$. Moreover, by (2) and
(3), $\g$ is a real subspace of $M(n)$, so it is
topologically closed, so
\[\lim_{t \to 0}\frac{\exp(tX)Y\exp(-tX) - Y}{h}\]
remains in the subspace. This is the definition of
the derivative of $\exp(tX)Y\exp(-tX)$ at $t = 0$, which has just been
shown to equal $XY-YX$. Therefore $\g$ is closed
under the bracket $[X,Y] = XY - YX$.
}

\par{This completes the proof that $\g$ is a Lie algebra, so our notion of โLie algebraโ is indeed a Lie algebra, and we can remove the scare quotes.}
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
We do not have the space to do much with the
bracket of a Lie algebra in this paper, so I would
at least like to remark on it here. Our bracket,
the commutator, is easily interpreted as a measure
of non-abelian-ness: if $X$ and $Y$ commute,
$[X,Y] = 0$, while if $XY$ and $YX$ differ
significantly, then $[X,Y] = XY - YX$ is very
large. The purpose of the bracket, then, is to
recover some of the non-abelian structure of the
group. If we did not endow our Lie algebra with a
bracket, our only operation would be vector
addition, which is commutative, so the algebra
would obliterate all of the non-abelian structure of
the group. For example, we saw above that
$\exp(X)\exp(Y) = \exp(X + Y)$ if and only if $X$
and $Y$ commute.
The full formula is the
\textbf{Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula}:
\[\exp(X)\exp(Y) = \exp(X + Y + \frac{1}{2}[X,Y] +
\frac{1}{12}([X,[X,Y]] + [Y,[Y,X]]) + \hdots),\]
continuing by adding higher-order compositions of
the commutator. Thus, the bracket allows us to
reprise non-commutative group operations on our
vector space. 
\end{rmk}

\par{Two straightforward facts about the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras follow. Then, we prove a theorem that gets us the rest of the significant results of this paper.}
\begin{defn} The identity component of $G$,
    denoted $G_0$, is the connected component of
    $G$ containing the identity. In the context of
    matrix Lie groups, connectedness is equivalent
    to path-connectedness, so $G_0$ is also
    the path-connected component of identity.
\end{defn}
    
\begin{prop} Let $G$ be a matrix Lie
group and $X \in \g$ an element of its Lie algebra.
Then $\exp(X) \in G_0$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} By the definition of $\g$,
$\exp(tX) \in G$, $\forall t \in \R$. Then for $t
: 0 \to 1$, $\exp(tX): I \to \exp(X)$, so $I$ and
$\exp(X)$ are path-connected, so $\exp(X) \in
G_0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
    If $G$ is commutative, then $\g$ is commutative.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
    For $X, Y \in M(n)$, we can calculate
\[
    [X,Y] = \frac{d}{dt}\Big(\frac{d}{ds}\exp(tX)\exp(sY)\exp(-tX)\Big|_{s=0}
    \Big)\Big|_{t=0}.
\] If $X, Y \in \g$ and $G$ is commutative, then $\exp(tX)$ commutes with $\exp(sY)$, giving 
\[\begin{aligned}
    [X, Y] & =
    \frac{d}{dt}\Big(\frac{d}{ds}\exp(tX)\exp(-tX)\exp(sY)\Big|_{s=0}\Big)\Big|_{t=0} \\
    & = \frac{d}{dt}\Big(\frac{d}{ds}\exp(sY)\Big|_{s=0}\Big)\Big|_{t=0}.
\end{aligned}\] We are differentiating a function that is independent of $t$ with respect to $t$, so $[X,Y] \equiv 0$, so $\g$ is commutative.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
    The reverse direction requires additionally that $G$ be
    connected. It will be shown shortly.
\end{rmk}

\begin{lem}
    Let $\{B_m\}$ be a sequence of matrices in $G$
    such that $B_m \to I$ as $m \to \infty$.
    Define $Y_m = \log B_m$, which is defined for
    all sufficiently large $m$ because $\log$ is
    defined around $I$. Suppose $Y_m \neq 0,
    \forall m$: this is equivalent to supposing
    $B_m \neq I, \forall m$. Define further that
    $Y_m / \V Y_m \V \to Y \in M(n)$ as $m \to
    \infty$. Then $Y \in \g$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
    For any $t \in \R, (t / \V Y_m \V)Y_m \to tY$
    by construction. $B_m \to I$, so $\V Y_m \V
    \to 0$. Then we can construct a sequence $k_m$
    such that $k_m \V Y_m \V \to t$. Then
\[\exp(k_m Y_m) = \exp\Big[(k_m \V Y_m \V)
\frac{Y_m}{\V Y_m \V} \Big] \to \exp(tY),\] since
the parentheses within the bracket approach $t$
and the fraction within the bracket approaches $Y$.
On the other hand, \[\exp(k_m Y_m) =
{(\exp(Y_m))}^{k_m}\] by a property of the
exponential map. This equals ${(B_m)}^{k_m}$ by
the definition of $B_m$, which is in $G$. This
implies that $\exp(tY) \in G$. Then by definition $Y
\in \g$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{them}
For $0 < \varepsilon < \log 2$, let $U_\varepsilon =
\{X \in M(n): \V X \V < \varepsilon\}$ and let
$V_\varepsilon = \exp(U_\varepsilon)$. Suppose $G
\subseteq GL(n)$ is a martrix Lie group with
Lie algebra $\g$. Then $\exists \varepsilon \in
(0, \log 2)$ such that $\forall A \in
V_\varepsilon$, $A \in G$ if and only if $\log A
\in \g$.
\end{them}\label{them:3.42}
\begin{proof}
\par{Begin by identifying $M(n)$ with $\C^{n^2}
\cong \R^{2n^2}$. Let $\g^\bot$ denote the
orthogonal complement of $\g$ with respect to the
usual inner product on $\R^{2n^2}$. Let $Z = X
\oplus Y$ with $X \in \g$ and $Y \in \g^\bot$.
Consider $\Phi: M(n) \to M(n)$ given by $\Phi(Z) =
\Phi(X,Y) = \exp(X) \exp(Y)$. The exponential is
smooth, so $\Phi$ is also smooth. By $D_Z\Phi(0)$
denote the derivive of $\Phi$ at $0$ in the
direction $Z$. Then
\[\begin{aligned}
    D_{(X,0)}\Phi(0,0) & = \frac{d}{dt}\Phi(tX,0)\Big|_{t=0} \\
    & = (X,0),
\end{aligned}\] and 
\[\begin{aligned}
    D_{(0,Y)}\Phi(0,0) & =
    \frac{d}{dt}\Phi(0,tY)\Big|_{t=0} \\
    & = (0,Y),
\end{aligned}\] both by direct calculation, employing the definition $\Phi(X,Y) = \exp(X)\exp(Y)$. Then 
\[\begin{aligned}
D_Z\Phi(0) & = D_{(X,Y)}\Phi(0,0) \\
& =  D_{(X,0) + (0,Y)}\Phi(0,0), 
\end{aligned}\] 
first by the definition of $Z$ and second simply
by addition. By the linearity of the derivative, this equals
\[\begin{aligned}D_{(X,0)}\Phi(0,0) + D_{(0,Y)}\Phi(0,0) & = (X,0)
+ (0,Y) \\ & = Z.\end{aligned}\] This is all to say that $D_Z\Phi(0) = Z$.
Clearly, then, the derivative of $\Phi$ is
nonsingular at $0$. Thus, the inverse function
theorem applies.} 
\par{By the inverse function
theorem, $\Phi$ has a continuous inverse in a
neighborhood of $\Phi(0) = I$.} \par{Let $A \in
V_\varepsilon \cap G$. Assume toward contradiction
that $\log A \not\in \g$. By the local inverse of
$\Phi$ permitted by the inverse function theorem, $A_m =
\exp(X_m)\exp(Y_m)$ for sufficiently large $m$, with $X_m, Y_m \to
0$ as $m \to \infty$. Then $Y_m \neq 0$, otherwise
we would have
\[\begin{aligned}
    \log A_m & = \log [\exp(X_m) \exp(Y_m)] \\ & = \log \exp(X_m) \in \g,    
\end{aligned}\]
which violates our supposition that $\log A \not
\in \g$. However, $\exp(X_m), A_m \in G$,
so defining 
\[\begin{aligned}B_m & = \exp(-X_m) A_m \\ & = \exp(Y_m) \in G.\end{aligned}\] The
unit sphere in $\g^\bot$ is compact, so there exists a
subsequence $\{Y_m\}$ such that $Y_m / \V Y_m \V$
converges to $Y \in \g^\bot$, where $\V Y \V = 1$.
But by the lemma this implies that
$Y \in \g$. Yet $\g^\bot$ is
the orthogonal complement of $\g$, so the two are
only trivially nondisjoint, so $Y \in \g$ and $Y
\in \g^\bot$ is a contradiction. Therefore,
there must be $\varepsilon$ such that $\log A \in
\g$ for all $A \in V_\varepsilon \cap G$. }
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    If $G$ is a matrix Lie group with
    corresponding Lie algebra $\g$, then $\exists
    U$ a neighborhood of $0$ in $\g$ and a
    neighborhood $V$ of $I$ in $G$ such that the
    exponential map takes $U$ homeomorphicallly
    onto $V$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small
    that~\ref{them:3.42} holds. Set $U =
    U_\varepsilon \cap \g$ and $V = V_\varepsilon \cap
    G$. Then~\ref{them:3.42} implies that $\exp: U
    \to V$ is surjective. Moreover, $\exp$ is a
    homeomorphism, since there is a continuous
    inverse map $\log\big|_{V}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:csg} (\textbf{Cartanโs Theorem}).
    Any closed subgroup $H$ of a Lie
group $G$ is a Lie subgroup (and thus a submanifold) of $G$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    By the previous corollary, $\exp^{-1}: U \to
    V$ is a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood
    of $I \in G$ to some neighborhood of $0 \in
    V$. This implies that $\exp^{-1}\big|_H: U
    \cap H \to V \cap \mathfrak{h}$ is a
    diffeomorphism from some neighborhood of $H$
    at the identity to some neighborhood of
    $\mathfrak{h}$ at the identity. Then
    $(H \cap U, \exp^{-1}\big|_H)$ is a chart, and
    we can use left translation to get a chart for
    any other $h \in H$~\cite{Wang}.

\end{proof}

\begin{cor} Let $G$ be a matrix Lie group with Lie
algbebra $\g$ and let $k$ be the dimension of $\g$
as a real vector space. Then $G$ is a smooth
submanifold of $M(n)$ of dimension $k$ and hence a
Lie group according to~\ref{def2}.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
In the interest of space, this proof, fairly
tedious, is omitted, with a reference to
(\cite{Hall}, 71).
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    Suppose $G \subseteq GL(n)$ is a matrix Lie
    group with corresponding Lie algebra $\g$.
    Then $X \in \g$ if and only if $\exists
    \gamma$ a smooth curve in $M(n)$ with
    $\gamma(t) \in G, \forall t$ and such that
    $\gamma(0) = I$ and $d\gamma/dt|_{t=0} = X$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
The forward direction is easy. Define
$\gamma(t) = \exp(tX)$. Then $\gamma(0) = I$
and $d\gamma/dt|_{t=0}=X$ by properties of
$\exp$ already established. In the other
direction, let $\gamma(t)$ be smooth with
$\gamma(0) = I$. For sufficiently small $t$,
$\gamma(t) = \exp(\delta(t))$, where $\delta$
is a smooth curve in $\g$. The derivative of
$\delta(t)$ at $t = 0$ is the same as the
derivative of $f(t): t \mapsto t \delta^{\prime}(0)$
at $t = 0$. This trick simplifies the algebra.
Then by the chain rule
\[\begin{aligned}
    \gamma^\prime(0) & = \frac{d}{dt}\exp(\delta(t))\Big|_{t=0} \\
    & = \frac{d}{dt}\exp(f(t))\Big|_{t=0} \\
    & = \frac{d}{dt}\exp(t\delta^\prime(0))\Big|_{t=0} \\
    & = \delta^\prime(0).
\end{aligned}\] Now $\gamma(t) \in G$ by construction, and $\exp(\delta(t)) = \gamma(t)$ for sufficiently small $t$, so $\delta(t) \in \g$ for sufficiently small $t$ by the definition of $\g$. Then also $\delta^\prime(0) \in \g$, so $\gamma^\prime(0) \in \g$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
    This means that $\g$ is the tangent space at
    the identity to $G$. Many textbooks work the
    other way, defining the Lie algebra as the
    tangent space at the identity and recovering
    other properties we already have.
\end{rmk}

To prove the next corollary, we require the
following lemma, which we state but do not prove.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:3.46}
    Suppose $A: [a, b] \to GL(n)$ is continuous.
    Then $\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists \delta >
    0$ such that for $s, t$ where $|s-t| <
    \delta$, $\V A(s) {A(t)}^{-1}-I \V < \varepsilon$.
\end{lem}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:3.47}
    If $G$ is a connected matrix Lie group, then
    every element $A$ of $G$ can be written in the
    form $A = \exp(X_1)\hdots\exp(X_m)$
    for $X_1, \hdots, X_m \in \g$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
\par{Let $V_\varepsilon = \exp(U_\varepsilon)$ for
$U_\varepsilon$ a neighborhood of $0$, as
in~\ref{them:3.42}. For $A \in G$, define a
continuous path $\gamma: [0,1] \to G$ where
$\gamma(0) = I$ and $\gamma(1) = A$.
By~\ref{lem:3.46}, we can pick $\delta > 0$
such that ${\gamma(s)\gamma(t)}^{-1} \in
V_\varepsilon$ for $|s - t| < \delta$.}

\par{Next, we partition $[0,1]$ into $m$ pieces of
size $1/m$, choosing $m$ so that $1/m < \delta$.
Then for $j \in \{1, \hdots, m\}$,
${\gamma((j-1)/m)}^{-1}\gamma(j/m) \in
V_\varepsilon$ because the two arguments are
within $\delta$ of each other. This implies that
\[
{\gamma((j-1)/m)}^{-1}\gamma(j/m) = \exp(X_j)
\] for some element $X_j \in \g$. Then
\[
\begin{aligned}
A & = \gamma(1) \\
& = \gamma(0) {\gamma(0)}^{-1} \gamma(1) \\
& = I \cdot {\gamma(0)}^{-1} \gamma(1) \\
& = {\gamma(0)}^{-1} \gamma(1) \\
& = {\gamma(0)}^{-1} \gamma(1/m) 
{\gamma(1/m)}^{-1} \hdots \gamma((m-1)/m)
{\gamma((m-1)/m)}^{-1} \gamma(1) \\
& = \exp(X_1) \hdots \exp(X_m) 
\end{aligned}\]

for $X_1, \hdots
X_m$ as constructed earlier.}   
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    If $G$ is a connected matrix Lie group and the
    Lie algebra $\g$ of $G$ is commutative, then
    $G$ is commutative.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
    Since $\g$ is commutative, any two elements of
    $G$, when written as in~\ref{cor:3.47}, will commute.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}
    If $G$ is a matrix Lie group, the identity
    component $G_0 \subseteq G$ is a closed
    subgroup of $GL(n)$ and thus a matrix Lie
    group. Moreover, $\g_0 = \g$.
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
\par{Take $\{A_m\}$, a sequence in $G_0$ converging to
some $A \in GL(n)$. If $G$ is a matrix Lie group,
then $G$ is closed under nonsingular limits
by~\ref{def3}, so $A \in G$. Moreover, $A_m
A^{-1} \in G$ for all $m$ because $G$ is a group.
Also, $A_m A^{-1} \to I$ as $m \to \infty$ because
$A_m \to A$. By~\ref{them:3.42}, $A_m A^{-1} =
\exp(X)$ for $X \in \g$ for $m$ large enough.
Left-multiplying by $\exp(-X)$ and
right-multiplying by $A$ gives $\exp(-X) A_m = A$.
Because $A_m \in G_0$ by construction, there is a
path joining $I$ to $G_0$. Since $\exp(-X)A_m =
A$, the path $\exp(-tX) A_m$ connects $A_m$ to
$A$, letting $t: 0 \to 1$. Combining this path
with the path from $I$ to $A_m$ provides a path
from $I$ to $A$, so $A \in G_0$. Therefore, $G_0$
is a closed subgroup of $GL(n)$, so it is a matrix
Lie group.}

\par{Now, since $G_0 \subseteq G$, it follows that
$\g_0 \subseteq \g$. Now, pick an arbitrary
element $X$ from $\g$. By the definition of $\g$,
we have $\exp(tX) \in G, \forall t \in \R$.
Consider an arbitrary element $Y = \exp(t_0X) \in
G$. Then $\exp(tX)$ connects $I$ to $Y$, letting
$t: 0 \to t_0$. Then $\g \subseteq \g_0$.
Therefore, $\g_0 = \g$.}
\end{proof}

\section{Examples.}

\par{I am not sure how to select the curriculum
for this somewhat artificial crash course on Lie
groups and Lie algebras. I hope that the preceding
section will give the reader some familiarity with
the basics of the correspondence between Lie
groups and Lie algebras. The original intention of
this section was to conclude by providing several
interesting examples. Here, I have kept the proofs
of the closure of the classical matrix groups but
removed all the examples I had of Lie groups that
are not matrix Lie groups.}

\par{I am more than happy to include these in my
final paper if you reviewers believe that the
exposition would be aided by examples that resist
the matrix-based approach. I thought it was a nice
and tidy to finish with proofs that the classical
groups are in fact matrix Lie groups, but I defer
to your preferences. The proofs that these are not
matrix Lie groups are pretty slick, but I doubted
that anyone would complain that this paper lacked
length, so I have excluded them for now.}

\par{The following proofs all go through very
similarly: we prove that each matrix group is the
preimage of a continuous function to a closed
set.}

\begin{them}$SL(n)$ is closed.\end{them}
\begin{proof}
    \par{The determinant map $\det: GL(n) \to
    \R^2$ is a polynomial in the entries of the
    input. The set $\{1\}$ is closed in $\C$. By
    definition $SL(n) = \{\det^{-1}(\{1\})\}$.}
    \par{$\therefore SL(n)$ is the preimage of a
    continuous function to a closed set, so it is
    closed.}
\end{proof}
    
\begin{them}$\son$ is closed.\end{them}
\begin{proof}
    \par{The determinant map $\det: GL(n, \R) \to
    \R$ is a polynomial in the entries of the
    input. Define $L: M(n, \R) \to M(n, \R)$ by
    $L(M) = M^T M$ and $R: M(n, \R) \to M(n, \R)$
    by $R(M) = MM^T$. The sets $\{1\}$ and $\{I\}$
    are closed. By definition $\son =
    \{L^{-1}(\{I\}) \cap R^{-1}(\{I\}) \cap
    \det^{-1}(\{1\})\}$.} \par{$\therefore \son$
    is the finite intersection of the preimage of
    continuous functions to closed sets, so it is
    closed (\cite{freakish}).}
\end{proof}

\begin{them}$SU(n)$ is closed.\end{them}
\begin{proof}
    This proof is identical to that for $\son$,
    \textit{mutatis mutandis}.
\end{proof}

\begin{them}$SP(n)$ is closed.\end{them}
\begin{proof}
    \par{Define $S: M(2n) \to M(2n)$ by $S(M) =
    A^T \Om A - \Om$. $S$ is a polynomial in the
    entries of the input, so it is continuous. The
    set $\{0\}$ is closed in $M(2n)$. By
    definition $SP(2n) = S^{-1}(\{0\})$.}
    \par{$\therefore SP(2n)$ is the preimage of a
    continuous function to a closed set, so it is
    closed (\cite{Heuber}).}
\end{proof}

Then, by~\ref{cor:csg}, these classical matrix
groups are Lie subgroups and therefore also
submanifolds of $GL(n)$ (or $GL(n, \R)$ in the case
of $\son$.)

\par{The following is a consequence of Peter-Weyl.}
\begin{them}
    All compact Lie groups
    are matrix groups.
\end{them}
\par{As this theorem suggests, there are
non-compact Lie groups that do not have faithful
representations as matrices. The most common
example of such a Lie group is the universal cover
of $SL(2)$. Another example, slightly easier to
show, is the quotient of the Heisenberg group $H$,
defined as
\[M \in M(n, \R) = \Bigg\{
\begin{pmatrix}
    1&a&c\\
    0&1&b\\
    0&0&1\\
\end{pmatrix} \Bigg\} \] 
by the discrete normal subgroup $N$
\[
    N \in H \cap M(n,\Z) = \Bigg\{
\begin{pmatrix}
    1&0&n\\
    0&1&0\\
    0&0&0\\
\end{pmatrix} \Bigg\}
\] is not a matrix Lie group.}

to read this, and I look forward to improving with
your feedback! $\heart \square$}
