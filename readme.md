this repository contains the LaTex source code and PDF output of a presentation I gave on Elementary Matrix Lie Theory for MATH 480: Mathematical Topics at Yale College in the spring semester of 2024.

the LaTeX source code for the presentation is in the file `emlt.tex`, and the PDF output is in the file `emlt.pdf`. the bibliography, without which the file would not compile, is in the file `refs.bib`.

the LaTeX source code for the handout for my second lecture is in the file `handout.tex`, and the PDF output is in the file `handout.pdf`.
